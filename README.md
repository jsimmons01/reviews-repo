# Reviews-repo
Reviews slide created with Javascript

## What did I learn?
I learned how to load an object using JavaScript. I used event listeners to toggle the prev, next, and random buttons. 


## What could I do differently?

Use Mongo DB to load data instead of hard coding. Also I the random button is useless, I think a better idea would be to continously loop through the reviews.
